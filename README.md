# Minecraftdle

 Minecrafdle is a fun and addictive word guessing game inspired by the popular browser game *Wordle*, with a unique twist for *Minecraft* fans! In this game, players must guess a hidden block, item or mob (depending on the game mode) related to the world of *Minecraft* in a certain number of attempts. Each guess gives feedback in the form of colored tiles that indicate how close the guesser is to the hidden object.

## About

Minecrafdle blends the popular mechanics of *Wordle* with the creative and adventurous spirit of *Minecraft*. The goal is simple: guess a hidden object (block, item or mob, depending on the game mode) related to *Minecraft* in the fewest number of attempts possible. The game offers feedback after each guess to help you figure out the correct object. The feedback follows the same color-coding system as *Wordle*:

- **Green:** attribute Is fully matched to the guess object..
- **Orange:** attribute is partially matched to the guess object..
- **Red:** attribute does not match guess object.

## Gameplay

There are 3 game modes in the game:

>### Blocks

- Color - checks if the color is the same as in the hidden block
- Craftable - checks if block is craftable or not
- Realm - checks in which realm the block exists
- Tool - checks what tool can break the block
- Verison - checks in which version the block was added
